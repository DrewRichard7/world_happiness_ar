title: "Simplified Conclusions"

---

tldr: 
- fish consumption has a statistically significant positive association with both the happiness and sadness scores. 
- sugar consumption has a statistically significant positive association with the happiness score, and a statistically significant negative association with the sadness score.
- after accounting for the fixed effects variables (`year`, `fish_consumption`, `sugar_consumption`), 86% of the variation in the happiness scores can be explained by differences in baseline happiness between countries.  
- after accounting for the fixed effects variables (`year`, `fish_consumption`, `sugar_consumption`), 98.87% of the variation in the sadness score can be explained by differences in baseline sadness between countries.
- while the significance of the fixed effects is very high for the sadness score, the effect they have is very small. 

More than likely, both of these consumables correspond with other variables that have a greater impact on the happiness / sadness scores, and are not as causal as initially expected. However, there has been some deeper examination into whether fish consumption has an impact on risk of depression that is contrary to the results reached in this app's analysis.
