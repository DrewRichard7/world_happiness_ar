tldr: 
- fish consumption has a statistically significant positive association with both the happiness and sadness scores. 
- sugar consumption has a statistically significant positive association with the happiness score, and a statistically significant negative association with the sadness score.
- after accounting for the fixed effects variables (`year`, `fish_consumption`, `sugar_consumption`), 86% of the variation in the happiness scores can be explained by differences in baseline happiness between countries.  
- after accounting for the fixed effects variables (`year`, `fish_consumption`, `sugar_consumption`), 98.87% of the variation in the sadness score can be explained by differences in baseline happiness between countries.
- while the significance of the fixed effects is very high for the sadness score, the effect they have is very small.
